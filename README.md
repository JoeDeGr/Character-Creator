# Charicter-Creator
Repository for my Sinatra Project Fantasy Character Creator This repository will allow you to build and describe a charicter based on specific character classes and link them to powers and locations. 

This is a Sinatra application that relies on ActiveRecord and uses bcrypt password protection, so please make sure all those items are installed. Clone the repo and bundle install and enjoy.
